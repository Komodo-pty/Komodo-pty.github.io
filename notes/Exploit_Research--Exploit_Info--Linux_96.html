<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Linux</h1><br/><p><h1>Dirty {Pipe,Sock,Cow}</h1></p><p>DirtyCow, DirtyPipe, and DirtySock are all  Linux PirvEsc vulnerabilities, but they are different in terms of how they work and when they were discovered.</p><p></p><p><h2>DirtyCow (CVE-2016-5195)</h2></p><p><strong>Discovered</strong>: 2016</p><p></p><p><strong>Vulnerability Type</strong>: Race condition in the mmap() system call</p><p></p><p><strong>How It Works</strong>: DirtyCow (short for &quot;Dirty Copy-On-Write&quot;) exploits a race condition in the Linux kernel&#39;s memory subsystem.</p><p></p><p>This race condition allows an unprivileged user to write to read-only memory mappings. By doing this, an attacker can gain write access to otherwise protected memory areas, potentially modifying files owned by root or escalating privileges.</p><p></p><p><strong>Impact</strong>: Allows local privilege escalation. The attacker could potentially gain root access.</p><p></p><p><h2>DirtyPipe (CVE-2022-0847)</h2></p><p><strong>Discovered</strong>: 2022</p><p></p><p><strong>Vulnerability Type</strong>: Pipe buffer overflow</p><p></p><p><strong>How It Works</strong>: DirtyPipe exploits a bug in the way Linux handles pipe buffers. An attacker can write to arbitrary memory locations by exploiting this vulnerability.</p><p></p><p>This allows them to overwrite data in files, including files that are normally read-only or owned by other users (including root). It is more efficient than DirtyCow because it doesn&#39;t require the race condition, making it easier to exploit.</p><p></p><p><strong>Impact</strong>: Like DirtyCow, it allows for local privilege escalation, giving attackers the ability to modify files and potentially gain root access.</p><p></p><p><h2>DirtySock (CVE-2025-2097)</h2><h2></h2></p><p><h2></h2><strong>Discovered</strong>: 2025 (still in early stages, info may evolve)</p><p></p><p><strong>Vulnerability Type</strong>: Likely to involve socket handling (though specific technical details may still be unfolding)</p><p></p><p><strong>How It Works</strong>: Not as much is publicly available yet regarding the exact mechanics.</p><p></p><p>Based on the name and the similarities to previous vulnerabilities, it likely exploits improper handling of socket buffers, potentially allowing attackers to overwrite memory regions or escalate privileges.</p><p></p><p><strong>Impact</strong>: Similar to DirtyCow and DirtyPipe, DirtySock would likely result in privilege escalation on a vulnerable system.</p><p></p><p><h2>Key Differences</h2></p><p>DirtyCow relies on a race condition in the memory handling of mmap() and works by exploiting copy-on-write semantics.</p><p></p><p>DirtyPipe is a more modern vulnerability that leverages buffer overflows in pipe management, and is generally considered simpler and faster to exploit than DirtyCow.</p><p></p><p>DirtySock (still emerging) is likely to target socket buffers or a different area of the Linux kernel, but its specifics are still under active investigation.</p></div>
