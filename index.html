<h1>README</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
  <p>I started studying Cyber Security in January of 2021, and it quickly became my passion. Since then, I've built my knowledge of Cyber Security by exploiting hundreds of vulnerable machines for Capture the Flag (CTF) exercises and by utilizing a variety of educational resources, like Portswigger Academy and DEF CON lectures. These experiences have allowed me to continuously explore novel attack vectors.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<h3>Freelance Pentesting</h3>
  <p>I performed penetration testing for an independent law firm, identifying vulnerabilities and recommending mitigation strategies. A redacted <a href="/assets/portfolio/redacted_Pentest_Report.pdf">report</a> and letter of recommendation is available upon request.</p>

<h3>Hackathon</h3>

  <b>January 2025</b>
  <p>I won first place in the expert division for the Operation 418 hacking competition. Over the course of the two day event, I compromised 16 machines across multiple networks. The goal was to identify and exfiltrate files with sensitive information, such as financial reports and customer data. The competition was organized by Virginia Tech and The Bulls Run Group.</p>

<h3>Homelab</h3>
  <p>I built and maintained a hybrid homelab using physical hardware and Xen-based virtual machines to gain hands-on experience in system administration, network configuration, and cybersecurity practices. Key projects and skills practiced include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Managing firewalls and configuring routing tables</li>
    <li>Pivoting with Port Forwarding, Proxying, and Tunneling</li>
    <li>Establishing Persistence and using C2 Frameworks</li>
    <li>Sniffing network traffic, and analyzing PCAPs</li>
    <li>Creating a Rogue AP for MitM and Captive Portal attacks</li>
    <li>Attacking network encryption (WPS and WPA Personal / Enterprise)</li>
    <li>Evading Antivirusâ€™ static and dynamic detection</li>
    <li>Hosting and attacking various Web Servers</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Certifications</h2>

<h3>OffSec Wireless Professional (OSWP)</h3>
  <p>I obtained the OSWP (PEN-210) in June of 2024. This certification covered the fundementals of wireless networks and WiFi security, including attacks and the corresponding mitigations. The exam required me to apply this knowledge in order to compromise various networks in order to obtain the sensitive files located within them (i.e. the "flag").</p>

<h3>In Progress</h3>
  <p>I am currently working on obtaining the OSCP.</p>
