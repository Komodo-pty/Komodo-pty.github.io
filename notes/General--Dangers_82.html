<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Dangers</h1><br/><p><h1>ISP Considerations</h1></p><p>Be careful when testing a public IP address, as ISPs may be unhappy if you enumerate public IPs at high speeds. This <span style="color:#ff0000;">isn&#39;t limited to port scans</span>, &amp; applies to any action that generates a lot of potentially &quot;suspicious&quot; traffic.</p><p></p><p>Some ISPs may be more restrictive than others, &amp; it can be hard to predict what actions they may flag as potentially maliclous. An ISPs standards may even change over time.</p><p></p><p>As a worst case scenario, I have heard of a Bug Bounty hunter that got dropped by their ISP who was concerned about them hacking websites. They resorted to using rented Cloud Servers for their Bug Bounties.</p><p></p><p><h2>Acceptable Risks</h2></p><p>Cursory research suggests that this is most likely to be an issue when you scan multiple hosts, or the same hosts multiple times, in rapid succession &amp; send potentially disruptive traffic.</p><p></p><p>A couple Nmap scans done occasionally will probably be fine.</p><p></p><p><h2>Safety Measures</h2></p><p><h3>Decreasing Traffic</h3></p><p>Enumeration that generates less traffic will be less likely to be flagged by an ISP (or your target&#39;s defenses). For example, an Nmap SYN Stealth scan may be better than the default TCP Connect scan.</p><p></p><p>Save you scan results to a file, so you won&#39;t need to repeat scans as much (unless you want to double check the scan results, etc).</p><p></p><p><h3>Decreasing Speed</h3></p><p>Faster scans are more likely to be flagged, as there&#39;s a higher chance they will cause disruptions. The default speed for Nmap is probably fine (<strong>-T3</strong>), but ideally you&#39;d reduce the scan speed speed further.</p><p></p><p><h3>Obscuring your Identity</h3></p><p>Ideally you&#39;d conduct your Pentest using another host, so your ISP wouldn&#39;t tie it to your network. Depending on the type of enumeration done, options include using:</p><p><ol><li>A Cloud Server</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>A Proxy (i.e. Nmap&#39;s Zombie Scan)</li></ol></p><p><ol><li>Tor</li></ol></p><p></p><p><span style="color:#8ff0a4;text-decoration:underline;">Caveats</span>: These will typically <span style="color:#ff0000;">decrease your speed</span> considerably. Depending on the type of enumeration, you may also <span style="color:#ff0000;">encounter issues</span> depending on the <a href="Pivoting_22.html#Protocols & the OSI Model">protocols</a> you&#39;ll be using.</p><p></p></div>
