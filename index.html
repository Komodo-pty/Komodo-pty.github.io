<h2>Certifications</h2>

<h3>OffSec Wireless Professional (OSWP)</h3>
<p>I obtained the OSWP (PEN-210) in June of 2024. This certification covered the fundementals of wireless networks and WiFi security, including attacks and the corresponding mitigations. The exam required me to apply this knowledge in order to compromise various networks in order to obtain the sensitive files located within them (i.e. the "flag").</p>

<h3>In Progress</h3>
<p>I am currently working on obtaining the OSCP.</p>
